# Hip-Hop-Magazine-Archive
Archive for hip-hop magazines and publications from the late 80's to the 2000's and beyond.

Inspired by Brian over at RapZines.com

HERE is a spreadsheet (please request access to contribute) with the metadata from hip-hop magazines.

# As a hip-hop archivist, I want to create a database using metadata from 3 issues from each of the following hip-hop magazines: The Source, VIBE and XXL, so I can provide a proof-of-concept for how I wants to perform a large-scale metadata extraction from hard copies of hip-hop publications
